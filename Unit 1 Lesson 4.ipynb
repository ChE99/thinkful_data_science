Are the medical professionals in the clinic highly trained and are there enough resources to properly diagnose anxiety? Perhaps the patients are easily diagnosed with anxiety when they don't necesarily have the condition due to the medical professionals' bias.\n",

Is it in a location where the population is more tech savvy and can easily access the internet upon seeing the billboard, i.e., urban vs. rural? How prominent is the billboard compared to the surroundings?\n",

    "4) When was the loyalty program initiated? It may not be the program itself that's the issue, but general economic conditions - patrons may have suffered personal economic setbacks that prevent them from participating. One week may be to quick of a timeframe to expect results; perhaps a month or a quarter would be more reasonable. To whom where the ads targeted? Perhaps they were already loyal patrons in the first place, and the marketing ad missed the casual patrons who would most likely drive up the visits."
