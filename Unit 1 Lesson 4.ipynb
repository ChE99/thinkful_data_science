Perhaps they were already loyal patrons in the first place, and the marketing ad missed the casual patrons who would most likely drive up the visits."

In this study, which will involve measuring average job satisfaction, it is imperative that subgroups within HR and IT are closely examined to verify if the subgroup trend reflects the overall trend. If they differ, the report's conclusions can't be driven by the author's bias - for example, advocating for condition A because the overall trend is positive, as opposed to condition B that is more favorable when based on a positive subgroup trend.
